## Experience Statement

I've been doing web dev for 2 years now, working with TypeScript and Rust as a Full Stack Developer. In the meantime, Iâ€™ve been learning blockchain development in Rust and, more recently, in Move.

I was introduced to Sui by starting a bootcamp organized by [Alex Tsiliris](https://github.com/Eis-D-Z) during which I deployed several Sui packages which included a file registry and NFT airdrop tool, additionally building frontends to interact with them.

I am comfortable writing in Move and working with a broad range of Sui development tools. I have also spent a lot of time with PTBs when building the file registry due to it also involving Walrus and storing their blobIds.
